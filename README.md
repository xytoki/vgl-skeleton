# vgl-skeleton

vue-gl components for skeletal animation including [spine](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/3.8/spine-ts) and [dragonbones](https://github.com/DragonBones/DragonBonesJS)

## Note
This module was developed and only tested with vue 3.x, so a special version of `vue-gl` is needed so far. You can find it at [xytoki/vue-gl](https://github.com/xytoki/vue-gl) before the official version can be used with vue3.

> You will need a license of `Spine Editor` if you're using the `vgl-spine` component since it includes the Spine runtime.
